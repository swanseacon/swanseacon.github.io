  title: "Do or don’t. There’s no try. Or is there?"
  description: "<h5>The power of monads explained. Sort of</h5>
  <p>One of the great things about being a programmer is that you never stop learning. Even after having programmed for almost 35 years, I still improve on the way I write code. Recently the way I write code changed once again when I started to apply monads and especially the Try class.</p>
  <p>During a recent project, my team created a small library that ports the behavior of the Scala Try monad. Although at first this new monad didn't appeal to me, I soon really started to appreciate this style of programming, where we concatenate series of Map() and FlatMap() methods, using lambda’s, and avoiding abundant try-catch blocks, and many if statements and null checks.</p>
  <p>In the meantime, I have contaminated many programmers with this style. Developers make it a sport to always start every method with a return statement. During this talk I’ll discuess lambda’s, closures and monads, and demonstrate the power of this simple monad, using many code examples (in Java, C# and TypeScript). Don't hesitate to join in.</p>"

  description: "<p>The Liskov Substitution Principle: the least known and most frequently violated of all S.O.L.I.D.!</p>
  <p>Let’s explore together what it is, why you should care, how to detect violations, how to stop violating, what is co-variance and contra-variance (What is the In/Out of C#, the Super/Extends of Java, the +/- of Scala).</p>
  <p>But above all: Let’s see that the essence of Liskov is the essence of Object Orientation itself: Systemics</p>
  <p>Let’s learn to see our codebase as a System.</p>"

In this session, you will see how to apply DDD, Systems Thinking, Promise Theory and more to design autonomous software services and autonomous teams to build and run them.</p>"

  title: "Testcontainers for Real Integration Tests"
  description: "<p>How are you doing integration tests with your datastore?<ul><li>Mocking is not an option since you want to test the actual system.</li><li>There are some in-memory implementations, like H2 or HSQLDB for relational databases, but there are still subtle differences to your production system and not all datastores have in-memory cousins.</li><li>Using the actual datastore in your tests is possible, but managing it, running tests in parallel,... is far from ideal.</li></ul></p>
  <p>So what is the solution? There is a very neat solution based on containers: TestContainers (https://www.testcontainers.org). From your tests you can start a lightweight, throwaway instance of your datastore and this talk will walk you through a practical example with Elasticsearch's TestContainer after covering the issues of other approaches first. We are also discussing the general approach of TestContainers and how they are now widely available for various datastores.</p>"

  description: "<p>In this talk we’ll discuss how an experimental approach to product development will lead to the many small failures that are essential to achieving great outcomes. We’ll share stories from our experience in startups and enterprises, the mistakes we made along the way and how we came to the realisation we needed to approach building products differently.</p>
  <p>We aim for you to leave knowing how to practically apply an experimental approach to your product development, how to create a culture of experimentation and to recognise the dangers of launching without learning first.</p>"

  <p>She'll be walking us through her journey - good and bad - and sharing the lessons she's learnt along the way. Expect to come away with a clear understanding of why she believes empathy and honesty are critical to successful product ownership, and how she's woven mutually-beneficial values such as partnership and respect into the day-to-day working ethos of both client- and supplier-side project teams... with award-winning effect.</p>"

Teams need disagreement to facilitate inspection and adaption, what if disagreement was an energy for creativity and transformation. Not only idealistic tools for dealing with our own animalistic nature when dealing with difficult people, I will share tools which have worked for me from listening better to practical agile tools to bring high conflict back to productive dialogue.</p>"

  <p>We’re going to put the Limited WIP theory to the test. We’ll prove once and for all whether limiting our work in progress will help us to be more productive, or whether this is just slowing us down and good old fashioned multi-tasking is actually the answer to our productivity challenges.</p>"

  <p>During therapy I learned techniques to help manage my anxiety. I'll be sharing how these can be helpful regardless of mental health status, and how to use them to monitor your own mental health so you can keep yourself mentally and physically healthy.</p>"

In this hands-on session, participants will get to practice ways to take that one line user story and start questioning it. What is the goal? Who will benefit from the story? Why should you implement it? Kristine and Lisa will explain frameworks to elaborate requirements together with testers, developers, product owners and other team members.

I wanted to learn where I stood in terms of my testing knowledge and at the same time improve my exploration and automation skills. So I decided to run an experiment and do a testing tour, pair testing with many different testers. In this talk, I will share the lessons learned on my journey as well as tips for doing pair testing sessions yourself.</p>"

  description: "<p>MySQL has several new features that will make your queries run faster.  Resource groups allow you to dedicate CPUs to certain groups of tasks and you will learn how to set up those groups and assign work to them. Histograms are a powerful tool for searching on secondary indexes.  New locking strategies provide much faster responses in contentious environments.  Optimizer hints let you direct query optimizations  without relying on built in heuristics. Sound good, then come to this session and learn to use the new features!</p>"

  <p>In this talk, just for fun, we'll find out how to parse a file. We'll look at simple, hand crafted parsers. We'll finally figure out just how lex and yacc work. And we'll pick apart structured parsers that build abstract syntax trees as you type - ReSharper style. How is an IDEs parser different to a compilers? How do you handle sensible error recovery? What about significant whitespace?</p>"
