  title: "Testing, Agile and DevOps - their roots and evolution"
  description: "<p>Testing has been around for a long time, but has changed a lot over the years. Agile and DevOps are “the new kids on the block” but are fast becoming mainstream. What are the roots of the changes and popularity of new approaches and how have they evolved over the years? What prophets were around years ago who foresaw current trends? In this presentation, Dorothy Graham leads you through some of her early experiences in testing and early encounters with precursors to Agile and DevOps. We look at why Agile has “taken off” and why DevOps is a hot topic today, and what the role of testing has been, is now and perhaps should be in the future.</p>"

  title: "Evil FizzBuzz"
  description: "<h5>Group workshop on Team Craft and Continuous Delivery</h5><p>You will work as part of a team to deliver a working program based on a popular coding exercise that, done alone, is very simple. But this exercise will be broken down into 5 individual requirements, and you will need to coordinate as a team - working individually or in pairs - to deliver the complete solution with each pair only allowed to code their part of the whole. You'll use version control and do Continuous Integration to pull the parts together, and - very importantly - YOU MUST NOT BREAK THE BUILD. In a time limit of one hour, 90% of teams who attempt Evil FizzBuzz fail. You'll have 1 hour to build your team, choose a technology stack, shave some yaks, agree on a design and implement it so that you can demonstrate a working program that passes a simple acceptance test to your 'customer'. You'll need more than Code Fu to master Evil FizzBuzz. Teams can be 5-10 people and a mix of individuals and pairs, depending on the size of the overall group.</p>"

  description: "<p>Curious about how to build and sustain a ‘remote-first’ culture? At Tes we have more engineers working from home or travelling than sitting at a desk in our London office. Over the last few years we adapted our engineering practices to support small teams working in close collaboration over distance. This talk will cover how we organise cross-team initiatives to sustain this way of working.</p>"

  title: "Quality not Quantity - Getting value out of test automation"
  description: "<p>Test automation is becoming more and more popular as part of a software testing strategy. However, there is a danger of using test automation incorrectly. If the wrong tests are automated, then the time and resource spent developing these tests is wasted and very little value is gained. If the right tests are automated, then the value gained from test automation can exceed the cost of developing the test. </p>
  <p>But how do we decide which tests are best to automate?</p>
  <p>In this talk, I will show how I try to get the most value out of automated testing by identifying problems with the current test strategy. Tests which are most likely to solve this problem are the ones chosen for automation. </p>
  <p>Following this, I will suggest various metrics that could be used to demonstrate the value and progress that has been gained from the introduction of automated tests. Demonstrating value is important as support for test automation development will be lost unless there is proven value.</p>"

  title: "Securing the web with AI"
  description: "<p>In today’s web not a week goes by without a large data breach or a website being hacked. Unlawful access to our online information can be prevented by encryption, 2FA and IP detection, but often this isn’t enough. Additionally tools like 2FA can be difficult to configure or understand for the initiated, leaving many at a disadvantage - security should be a right, not a privilege.</p>
  <p>This session explores some interesting and experimental ways that AI could be used to improve security and protect users on the web.</p>
  <p>Using existing AI tools like Azure Cognitive Services we’ll look at ways facial or voice recognition could be used as part of 2FA to make security more accessible to end users, including code examples in .NET and JavaScript. Then we’ll investigate some simple methods to find patterns in user behaviour, such as login times and mouse behaviour, to detect anomalies and take action.</p>
  <p>Finally, we’ll see how machine learning can be used to identify fraudulent text or photoshopped images within webpages and warn users of scams before it becomes an issue.</p>
  <p>Code examples will be given in a mix of .NET and JavaScript.</p>"

  title: "The Good, the Bad and the Avoidable SQL Practicies"
  description: "<p>Code quality matters!</p>
  <p>You probably have worked with SQL queries before. What was the experience like? Have you ever looked at a piece of SQL and thought... G! that's ugly! Have you seen a query that worked just fine in development but annoyingly not in production, or it used to work for a while, but then started timing out without any change or a warning?</p>
  <p>This session is for you! Let's take a hard look at SQL code quality. I will show you some ugly queries and teach you how to transform them into good, clean code, that not only looks right but also performs well.</p>"

  title: "It's not me, or you…it's both of us: why your messages aren't getting through"
  description: "<p>How many times have you tried to explain something to your team…to only have blank faces stare back at you? Has someone asked you to do a task…but what you end up doing turns out to be not what they wanted? Is one team being effective…while another is lagging behind? Using social science models as our guide, we can see why teams can have problems communicating – especially in certain stages of a project's lifetime – and what we can do to address this.</p>
  <p>We'll start by looking at the Shannon Weaver communication model (1949) and what it tells us about the different phases of successful communication. With this model we'll be able to address exactly where problems can be found between individuals, and how messages can be interpreted inaccurately or sometimes even lost all together. You'll find that the responsibility of effective communication relies on all participants, and not just those receiving the message. After identifying common problems, we'll discuss some potential solutions for you to try implementing with your own teams.</p>
  <p>But is good communication enough in tough times? By looking at Tuckman's team development model (1965), we'll be able to evaluate why even the best communication practices can fail depending on what stage of development a team is currently in. But…we can do things to address this! We'll look at how communication methods will need to be adapted when teams face tough times, and how comparing the Tuckman and Shannon Weaver models together can better inform our understanding of each.</p>
  <p>Attendees should come away with some insight in to what goes in to successful communication, the lifecycle that teams go through, and what methods can be used to address common problems we may find with these. Ultimately, an agile approach to both is what will ensure happy successful teams.</p>"

  description: "<p>Even today, there exist development teams in which the whole burden of product quality falls on testers' shoulders. This can cause from delays of deliveries to fights within the team about severe bugs deployed to production. By converting a tester into a quality coach, the quality load can be distributed, helping everybody in the team work better.</p>"

  title: "Improving System Resiliency via Chaos Engineering"
  description: "<p>Advances in Cloud technology means systems are becoming increasingly more distributed and complex. Large monoliths are being split up into microservices, we're depending on more remote services and Functions as a Service (FaaS)/Serverless are becoming increasingly common. The very nature of distributed systems mean they're far more prone to failures than similarly-scoped monoliths; this makes predicting or preventing possible failure modes increasingly more difficult.</p>
  <p>In this talk we'll look at how we can harness Chaos Engineering, a discipline pioneered by Netflix, to better understand our systems, their failure modes and how we can use this information to improve system overall resiliency and reliability.</p>"

  title: "Valuable Retrospectives"
  description: "<p>We often curse meetings, poorly designed or facilitated retrospectives seem to simply drain people's energy without delivering any meaningful output.</p>
  <p>This workshop will explore what makes a great retrospective, furnish you with the beginnings of a great toolbox, and take everyone through a full retrospective delivered over the course of the talk.</p>
  <p>As a group, we'll explore the flow of retrospectives, highlighting and using useful tools that can be used in different parts of the process.  This won't be exhaustive, but everyone should leave with a few extra things in their box.</p>
  <p>While there will be slides, everyone will form themselves into groups, and will then actively participate in a full-scale retrospective example, where we will explore our relationship with meetings at our place of work.  The aim is to deliver a fully interactive workshop, where everyone learns about the subject by actually doing it.  The activities are carefully spaced over the talk and immediately follow the relevant learning sections.</p>
  <p>While this talk will furnish everyone with a few example structures, the main purpose is to teach how to structure your own.  Everyone should leave with the ability to build their own retrospectives from scratch, pulling in influence from what's happening within the team at that time.</p>"

  title: "Introduction to Containers In Practice"
  description: "<p>Bring a laptop and step into a guided tour of what containers are and how to use them in practice. No buzzwords or vague statements about accelerating delivery, just straight-up information and hands-on experience.</p>
  <p>You'll get to build and run containers for yourself. We'll start by installing Docker and I'll aim to get you to the point where you're running your own multi-container application. No previous container experience is needed, but you'll need to be comfortable using a command-line and have a general understanding of networking concepts like ports and web servers.</p>
  <p>If you're interested in technologies like Kubernetes, container scheduling and Gitops, the aim of this workshop is to get you from a clean slate to a declarative, multi-container application, understanding the concepts involved and setting you up to go on and explore. We won't attempt to get Kubernetes running in this workshop because of time constraints, but I'm happy to talk about my experience of using it.</p>
  <p>Note: if you're bringing a Windows machine, please double-check the Docker installation requirements here to make sure you'll be able to get Docker running: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/. Older versions of Windows aren't ideal so if in doubt, and if you're comfortable running a Linux virtual machine or using a cloud machine instance, then you'll still be able to do the workshop. I'll recommend you go with Ubuntu because I'm most familiar with it for installing Docker so it'll make it easiest to support you.</p>"
