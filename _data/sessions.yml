  title: "Opening Keynote: Where's my free lunch"
  description: "<p>Have you ever thought about how many amazing things we get in this day and age that are free? Think about it, whether it’s articles in daily newspapers, social media, your code repository, your continuous integration server as a service. And that’s not even mentioning all the amazing open source libraries, frameworks that’s all out there. It’s all free, and it’s awesomesauce! Reality though is someone is paying for all this. Sometimes it’s being paid in cash, other times in the form of data and many times in the form of liabilities. But many of us choose to ignore this and glaze at the wonder of it all. One day however, we’ll wake up and ask, hey, where the hell did my free lunch go, and watch how a lot of things come crumbling down.</p>"

  title: "Nature of Learning"
  description: "<p>Learning is a part of our survival and key to professional success. Understanding its nature helps us to become better learners. In our industry, where technologies and practices evolve so fast, effective learning is an absolute necessity. I will explore the nature of learning from learning styles to the tools that we use to learn. I will discuss our motivation for learning and the importance of active learning. It is too important for us to simply stumble through, our approach to learning must be deliberate.</p>"

  title: "Do or don’t. There’s no try. Or is there?"
  description: "<h5>The power of monads explained. Sort of</h5>
  <p>One of the great things about being a programmer is that you never stop learning. Even after having programmed for almost 35 years, I still improve on the way I write code. Recently the way I write code changed once again when I started to apply monads and especially the Try class.</p>
  <p>During a recent project, my team created a small library that ports the behavior of the Scala Try monad. Although at first this new monad didn't appeal to me, I soon really started to appreciate this style of programming, where we concatenate series of Map() and FlatMap() methods, using lambda’s, and avoiding abundant try-catch blocks, and many if statements and null checks.</p>
  <p>In the meantime, I have contaminated many programmers with this style. Developers make it a sport to always start every method with a return statement. During this talk I’ll discuess lambda’s, closures and monads, and demonstrate the power of this simple monad, using many code examples (in Java, C# and TypeScript). Don't hesitate to join in.</p>"

  <p>Let’s explore together what it is, why you should care, how to detect violations, how to stop violating, what is co-variance and contra-variance (What is the In/Out of C#, the Super/Extends of Java, the +/- of Scala).</p>
  <p>But above all: Let’s see that the essence of Liskov is the essence of Object Orientation itself: Systemics</p>
  <p>Let’s learn to see our codebase as a System.</p>"

  title: "Testcontainers for Real Integration Tests"
  description: "<p>How are you doing integration tests with your datastore?<ul><li>Mocking is not an option since you want to test the actual system.</li><li>There are some in-memory implementations, like H2 or HSQLDB for relational databases, but there are still subtle differences to your production system and not all datastores have in-memory cousins.</li><li>Using the actual datastore in your tests is possible, but managing it, running tests in parallel,... is far from ideal.</li></ul></p>
  <p>So what is the solution? There is a very neat solution based on containers: TestContainers (https://www.testcontainers.org). From your tests you can start a lightweight, throwaway instance of your datastore and this talk will walk you through a practical example with Elasticsearch's TestContainer after covering the issues of other approaches first. We are also discussing the general approach of TestContainers and how they are now widely available for various datastores.</p>"

We’ll share stories from our experience in startups and enterprises, the mistakes we made along the way and how we came to the realisation we needed to approach building products differently.</p>
  <p>We aim for you to leave knowing how tohow to practically apply an experimental approach to your product development, how to create a culture of experimentation and to recognise the dangers of launching without learning first.</p>"

  <p>She'll be walking us through her journey - good and bad - and sharing the lessons she's learnt along the way. Expect to come away with a clear understanding of why she believes empathy and honesty are critical to successful product ownership, and how she's woven mutually-beneficial values such as partnership and respect into the day-to-day working ethos of both client- and supplier-side project teams... with award-winning effect.</p>"

I wanted to learn where I stood in terms of my testing knowledge and at the same time improve my exploration and automation skills.

In this talk, I will share the lessons learned on my journey as well as tips for doing pair testing sessions yourself.</p>"

Resource groups allow you to dedicate CPUs to certain groups of tasks and you will learn how to set up those groups and assign work to them. Histograms are a powerful tool for searching on secondary indexes.  New locking strategies provide much faster responses in contentious environments.  Optimizer hints let you direct query optimizations  without relying on built in heuristics. Sound good, then come to this session and learn to use the new features!</p>"

  title: "Culture for the win"
  description: "<p>Based in Finland and with a growing team in Swansea, our roots are in agile software development. Right from the start of the company, we decided to include a people focus in everything we do. We believe that a motivated and happy team deliver superior quality results - be they software, business consulting or even a mobile app.</p>
  <p>Traditionally digital transformation projects are focussed on software and processes, we wanted to include the people aspect. So we developed something that we call Minimum Viable Management. We live and breathe minimum viable management and, at Gofore we truly empower all of our employees. Many of our company processes are managed online, some using proprietary tools developed by our crew.</p>
  <p>As a testament to the success of our minimum viable management, Gofore won the Best Workplace in Finland and was runner up in the Best workplace in Europe 2017.</p>
  <p>Our unique way of working is quite different to others in the industry, amongst other things, we have our own Crew clothing, funky offices and great coffee. Goforeans as we call ourselves, manage their own time, work from wherever they consider appropriate and have developed a thriving company community. With teams based in Finland, Germany, Spain and the UK we operate as 'one company'. For example, the team in Swansea work seamlessly with clients across Europe and the US together with colleagues from Finland, Germany and Spain.</p>
  <p>A key element of our company culture is transparency and we love to share our learning with others. Listen to our experience of minimum viable management, share your thoughts and discuss how empowerment and transparency can help deliver better employees and better solutions.</p>"
