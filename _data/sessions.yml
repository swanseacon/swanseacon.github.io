  title: "Opening Keynote - Agile and architecture, finally friends after 15 years"
  description: "The term '"'software architecture'"' has historically induced visions of ivory tower architects doing big design up front in order to create excessively detailed documents, delivered to an unsuspecting development team as if they were the second leg of a relay race. 2001 saw the creation of the '"'Manifesto for Agile Software Development'"', a turning point for the software development industry that put focus back upon individuals and interactions, working software, customer collaboration and responding to change. Big design up front certainly has problems but, in the haste for agility, some teams threw the baby out with the bath water. Big design up front was replaced with no design up front, documentation was seen as redundant, speculation became YAGNI and a new wave of '"'agile architects'"' (who, of course, didn't call themselves architects) delayed decisions until the last responsible moment. Although agile and architecture may have parted ways, they are finally friends again after 15 years. This is their story."

  <p>This workshop will introduce attendees to Kano Analysis, including how it can be used to categorise features for release planning.  We'll discuss how to form questions to ask customers, how to interpret answers to those questions, and how to plan a release using those answers.</p>
  <p>The workshop will encourage participation from attendees and use lots of examples to explore the topic.  We'll use Kano to analyse SwanseaCon 2016 itself and explore what aspects of the conference would be classified as basic, linear and exciting features.</p>"

  title: "How deep are your tests?"
  description: "<p>Manual testing is most often done end-to-end. Tests are performed through the user interface. When testing gets automated, this is where most organisations start. They start with automating the way they do things now. The new way is faster, but it isn’t fast enough. And not robust enough.</p>
  <p>It is unnecessarily complicated to understand why an end-to-end test fails. There are usually many different possibilities when something doesn’t work.</p>
  <p>The number of possible paths through a reasonably large application will very fast make it impossible to cover them all. Combinatorics is your enemy.</p>
  <p>The solution is to minimise the tests that passes through many layers in your application. Minimising doesn’t mean removing the end-to-end tests. They are still needed. But much fewer than most organisations seem to think.</p>
  <p>I will show you why the testing pyramid need to be very wide. You will understand why this is an absolute necessity if all possible paths through the application should be tested.</p>
  <p>In other words, let me show you why your tests must be very shallow.</p>"

  title: "Education for Engineers"
  description: "<p>How can we best design education programmes that prepare students to be effective software engineers in the modern world? What do they need to learn? How can we teach these things? Post-university, can we use the same principles to develop effective training and development programmes for professionals?</p>
  <p>Many university degree programmes provide students with a solid grounding in the theoretical basis of computing, but it is difficult in a university environment to provide training in the types of software engineering techniques and practices, such as agile methods, that are commonly used in industrial development projects. There is typically a large gap between theoretical knowledge and practical experience.</p>
  <p>In this session we will present how we have developed a programme that aims to bridge this gap, providing students with practical experience of relevant skills for industrial software engineering careers. We will give examples from courses at both Imperial College and Oxford. We are aiming to create courses that are practical and industrially relevant, but built on the fundamentals of computer science and rigorous engineering.</p>
  <p>The first part of this session will be a talk giving some reflections on trying to improve the quality of a university course. Taking inspiration from modern ideas on lean and continuous delivery, we tried to adapt the course to provide higher quality learning, and give more value to the time the students spent studying. Universities are traditional organisations with long histories of doing things a certain way, and so whilst we had a lot of freedom over the content of the course, changing the format and the delivery methods was a lot harder.</p>
  <p>We applied principles and tools from agile methods, aiming to increase the value of the time the students spent studying by providing feedback and learning in smaller batches, aided by automation. On a practical level, we will discuss the use of version control, automated testing, automated build and continuous integration for student exercises, and the effects that this has had. We will also discuss our attempts to teach the value of continuous delivery in larger student projects, the problems we have had with this, and ideas for future improvements.</p>"

  description: "<p>What happens when the very frameworks, tools and patterns we cherish take the reins and forces us to focus on all the boilerplate scaffolding things, distracting us from really solving the real problems? Sometimes the outside-in approach can lead us to code that is more complex and coupled than it has to be.</p>
  <p>Eager Design offers a fresh approach. Instead of being led by the delivery mechanisms, frameworks and patterns, we focus on the problems worth solving. Inspired by functional programming and Domain Driven Design, the principles of Eager Design helps us isolate and solve complex problems in a more focused and decouple manner.</p>
  <p>Principles covered:
  <ul><li>The problem with Outside-in development</li>
  <li>Identifying opportunities for Eager Design</li>
  <li>Jumping to the problem worth solving</li>
  <li>Eagerly replacing primitives with values</li>
  <li>Behaviour over state</li>
  <li>Abstracting boundaries</li>
  <li>Functional patterns applied in object oriented (immutability and persistency, identifying small units of behaviour, monoids, etc)</li></ul></p>"

  description: "<p>Estimation is the weak spot of agile methodologies. Current methods for task estimation are subjective and inconsistent. This often results in failed sprints, which -in turn- lead to delivery failures, loss of credibility and team friction. We can't always estimate complexity and effort accurately, but there is a way to ensure our estimates are the best we can give, every single time, all the time.</p>
  <p>The USP (User Story Point) estimation method is an algorithmic approach that takes into account technical and environmental factors affecting a User Story and uses a mathematical formula to produce a complexity point value.</p>

  <p>In the red corner, we have Elizabeth Ayer, Product Manager at Redgate. She loves Minimum Viable Products, cunning experiments, and The Lean Startup is her bible. Craftsmanship to her means wasting time polishing internals. Everyone loves sausages regardless of what goes on inside the factory.</p>
  <p>In the blue corner, we have Alastair Smith, Founder of the Cambridge Software Craftsmanship Community. He loves clean code, test-driven development, and The Pragmatic Programmer is his bible. Lean product development to him means half-finished products, mountains of technical debt. It’s less “fail cheap, fail often”, than just simply “#fail”.</p>
  <p>Does Craftsmanship take focus off the end user? Does Lean make poor trade-offs between speed and quality? Can the same team follow both principles? Alastair and Elizabeth will explore common misconceptions, as well as genuine areas of contention between the two approaches. Come see if they can ever join forces to create products users love.</p>"

  What if we’d get a proper User representation from the domain. Whether it is a user with or without a picture, or if it is a NullObject (UserThatDoesNotExistInSystem), the details don’t need to pollute the views.</p>
  <p>In this talk, I will show one possible solution for case like that – getting a User representation from the domain and displaying relevant information in web views. The information rendered in UI differs based on whether user exists or not, it’s data and whether the user is being edited or is only to be viewed.</p>
