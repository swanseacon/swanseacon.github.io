  description: "This talk will detail the process of moving away from a ‘classic’ SCRUM based approach to planning (by using release planning, iteration planning, story points estimation using planning poker, etc) to an alternative method that uses a no estimate based approach.</p>
  <p>The presentation will cover techniques that enable transitioning to this approach, such as: how to define work in progress, how to monitor throughput and ageing items, replenishment and right sizing as well as the use of Monte Carlo simulations for forecasting.</p>
  <p>The techniques are based on Daniel Vacanti’s ‘Actionable Agile Metrics for Predictability’ and the presentation will contain practical aspects of how they have been applied at a major UK client.</p>"

  title: "How deep are your tests?"
  description: "<p>Manual testing is most often done end-to-end. Tests are performed through the user interface. When testing gets automated, this is where most organisations start. They start with automating the way they do things now. The new way is faster, but it isn’t fast enough. And not robust enough.</p>
  <p>It is unnecessarily complicated to understand why an end-to-end test fails. There are usually many different possibilities when something doesn’t work.</p>
  <p>The number of possible paths through a reasonably large application will very fast make it impossible to cover them all. Combinatorics is your enemy.</p>
  <p>The solution is to minimise the tests that passes through many layers in your application. Minimising doesn’t mean removing the end-to-end tests. They are still needed. But much fewer than most organisations seem to think.</p>
  <p>I will show you why the testing pyramid need to be very wide. You will understand why this is an absolute necessity if all possible paths through the application should be tested.</p>
  <p>In other words, let me show you why your tests must be very shallow.</p>"

  title: "Education for Engineers"
  description: "<p>How can we best design education programmes that prepare students to be effective software engineers in the modern world? What do they need to learn? How can we teach these things? Post-university, can we use the same principles to develop effective training and development programmes for professionals?</p>
  <p>Many university degree programmes provide students with a solid grounding in the theoretical basis of computing, but it is difficult in a university environment to provide training in the types of software engineering techniques and practices, such as agile methods, that are commonly used in industrial development projects. There is typically a large gap between theoretical knowledge and practical experience.</p>
  <p>In this session we will present how we have developed a programme that aims to bridge this gap, providing students with practical experience of relevant skills for industrial software engineering careers. We will give examples from courses at both Imperial College and Oxford. We are aiming to create courses that are practical and industrially relevant, but built on the fundamentals of computer science and rigorous engineering.</p>
  <p>The first part of this session will be a talk giving some reflections on trying to improve the quality of a university course. Taking inspiration from modern ideas on lean and continuous delivery, we tried to adapt the course to provide higher quality learning, and give more value to the time the students spent studying. Universities are traditional organisations with long histories of doing things a certain way, and so whilst we had a lot of freedom over the content of the course, changing the format and the delivery methods was a lot harder.</p>
  <p>We applied principles and tools from agile methods, aiming to increase the value of the time the students spent studying by providing feedback and learning in smaller batches, aided by automation. On a practical level, we will discuss the use of version control, automated testing, automated build and continuous integration for student exercises, and the effects that this has had. We will also discuss our attempts to teach the value of continuous delivery in larger student projects, the problems we have had with this, and ideas for future improvements.</p>"

  title: "Introducing Eager Design"
  description: "<p>What happens when the very frameworks, tools and patterns we cherish take the reins and forces us to focus on all the boilerplate scaffolding things, distracting us from really solving the real problems? Sometimes the outside-in approach can lead us to code that is more complex and coupled than it has to be.</p>
  <p>Eager Design offers a fresh approach. Instead of being led by the delivery mechanisms, frameworks and patterns, we focus on the problems worth solving. Inspired by functional programming and Domain Driven Design, the principles of Eager Design helps us isolate and solve complex problems in a more focused and decouple manner.</p>
  <p>Principles covered:
  <ul><li>The problem with Outside-in development</li>
  <li>Identifying opportunities for Eager Design</li>
  <li>Jumping to the problem worth solving</li>
  <li>Eagerly replacing primitives with values</li>
  <li>Behaviour over state</li>
  <li>Abstracting boundaries</li>
  <li>Functional patterns applied in object oriented (immutability and persistency, identifying small units of behaviour, monoids, etc)</li></ul></p>"

  title: "User-Story Point estimation: a new approach"
  description: "<p>Estimation is the weak spot of agile methodologies. Current methods for task estimation are subjective and inconsistent. This often results in meaningless values for team velocity, which -in turn- leads to delivery failures, loss of credibility and team friction. We can't always estimate complexity and effort accurately, but there is a way to ensure our estimates are the best we can give, every single time, all the time. The USP (User Story Point) estimation methods is an algorithmic approach to story estimates that takes into account:<ul>
  <li>The technical requirements of the user story, such as concurrency, security, and performance.</li>
  <li>Various environmental factors such as the development teams’ experience, knowledge and morale.</li></ul></p>
  <p>The USP method then uses a mathematical formula that accepts the technical and environmental inputs and produces a calculated point value for the user story. USP has the following advantages:
  <ol>
  <li>Comprehensive analysis: the method makes developers think about every single factor that affects their ability to realise and deliver the story.</li>
  <li>Objectivity: USP estimation introduces a number of technical and environmental factors that have been shown to affect the calculation of task estimates.</li>
  <li>Consistency: Given the same conditions, the same estimate will be produced again and again with only minor deviations.</li></ol></p>
  <p>Finally we will talk about analysing how velocity is affected by USP and how it should be used in order to be an effective planning tool.</p>"

  description: "<p>You want to get your product out to users, but you want to write clean code. Test your market fast but keep the product maintainable. Lean product development and software craftsmanship just can’t work together, right?</p>
  <p>In the red corner, we have Elizabeth Ayer, Product Manager at Redgate. She loves Minimum Viable Products, cunning experiments, and The Lean Startup is her bible. Craftsmanship to her means wasting time polishing internals. Everyone loves sausages regardless of what goes on inside the factory.</p>
  <p>In the blue corner, we have Alastair Smith, Founder of the Cambridge Software Craftsmanship Community. He loves clean code, test-driven development, and The Pragmatic Programmer is his bible. Lean product development to him means half-finished products, mountains of technical debt. It’s less “fail cheap, fail often”, than just simply “#fail”.</p>
  <p>Does Craftsmanship take focus off the end user? Does Lean make poor trade-offs between speed and quality? Can the same team follow both principles? Alastair and Elizabeth will explore common misconceptions, as well as genuine areas of contention between the two approaches. Come see if they can ever join forces to create products users love.</p>"

  #if ( $user != null)<br>
  #show user information<br>
  #endif<br>
  I mean, didn’t we just study Object Orientation to use polymorphism just for that sort of thing.</p>
  <p>What if.<br>
  <br>
  What if we’d get a proper User representation from the domain. Whether it is a user with or without a picture, or if it is a NullObject (UserThatDoesNotExistInSystem), the details don’t need to pollute the views.</p>
  <p>In this talk, I will show one possible solution for case like that – getting a User representation from the domain and displaying relevant information in web views. The information rendered in UI differs based on whether user exists or not, it’s data and whether the user is being edited or is only to be viewed.</p>
  <p>The patterns used in the code include (but are not limited to)
  <ul><li>Exhibit pattern (Avdi Grimm, Object on Rails)</li>
  <li>Command-Query Responsibility Segregation</li></ul>
  The best part is. This is live production code written and maintained. By spring 2015 I believe I have gotten some insights about the work, which I am happy to share with.</p>
