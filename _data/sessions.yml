  title: "Testing, Agile and DevOps - their roots and evolution"
  description: "<p>Testing has been around for a long time, but has changed a lot over the years. Agile and DevOps are “the new kids on the block” but are fast becoming mainstream. What are the roots of the changes and popularity of new approaches and how have they evolved over the years? What prophets were around years ago who foresaw current trends? In this presentation, Dorothy Graham leads you through some of her early experiences in testing and early encounters with precursors to Agile and DevOps. We look at why Agile has “taken off” and why DevOps is a hot topic today, and what the role of testing has been, is now and perhaps should be in the future.</p>"

  title: "Introducing Selenium 4"
  description: "<p>Selenium 4 is coming! The team have been working hard since the last 3.x release to add new features and improve the experience of developing with Selenium. In this talk, we’ll walk through updating an existing java Selenium test suite and scaling it up to run on Grid 4 hosted in the cloud. Not only will you see how easy the upgrade will be, you’ll also discover the new features added in Selenium 4.</p>"

  title: "Evil FizzBuzz"
  description: "<h5>Group workshop on Team Craft and Continuous Delivery</h5><p>You will work as part of a team to deliver a working program based on a popular coding exercise that, done alone, is very simple. But this exercise will be broken down into 5 individual requirements, and you will need to coordinate as a team - working individually or in pairs - to deliver the complete solution with each pair only allowed to code their part of the whole. You'll use version control and do Continuous Integration to pull the parts together, and - very importantly - YOU MUST NOT BREAK THE BUILD. In a time limit of one hour, 90% of teams who attempt Evil FizzBuzz fail. You'll have 1 hour to build your team, choose a technology stack, shave some yaks, agree on a design and implement it so that you can demonstrate a working program that passes a simple acceptance test to your 'customer'. You'll need more than Code Fu to master Evil FizzBuzz. Teams can be 5-10 people and a mix of individuals and pairs, depending on the size of the overall group.</p>"

  title: "Keynote - Sustaining Remote-First Teams"
  description: "<p>Curious about how to build and sustain a ‘remote-first’ culture? At Tes we have more engineers working from home or travelling than sitting at a desk in our London office. Over the last few years we adapted our engineering practices to support small teams working in close collaboration over distance. This talk will cover how we organise cross-team initiatives to sustain this way of working.</p>"

  title: "Securing the web with AI"
  description: "<p>In today’s web not a week goes by without a large data breach or a website being hacked. Unlawful access to our online information can be prevented by encryption, 2FA and IP detection, but often this isn’t enough. Additionally tools like 2FA can be difficult to configure or understand for the initiated, leaving many at a disadvantage - security should be a right, not a privilege.</p>
  <p>This session explores some interesting and experimental ways that AI could be used to improve security and protect users on the web.</p>
  <p>Using existing AI tools like Azure Cognitive Services we’ll look at ways facial or voice recognition could be used as part of 2FA to make security more accessible to end users, including code examples in .NET and JavaScript. Then we’ll investigate some simple methods to find patterns in user behaviour, such as login times and mouse behaviour, to detect anomalies and take action.</p>
  <p>Finally, we’ll see how machine learning can be used to identify fraudulent text or photoshopped images within webpages and warn users of scams before it becomes an issue.</p>
  <p>Code examples will be given in a mix of .NET and JavaScript.</p>"

  title: "The Good, the Bad and the Avoidable SQL Practicies"
  description: "<p>Code quality matters!</p>
  <p>You probably have worked with SQL queries before. What was the experience like? Have you ever looked at a piece of SQL and thought... G! that's ugly! Have you seen a query that worked just fine in development but annoyingly not in production, or it used to work for a while, but then started timing out without any change or a warning?</p>
  <p>This session is for you! Let's take a hard look at SQL code quality. I will show you some ugly queries and teach you how to transform them into good, clean code, that not only looks right but also performs well.</p>"
