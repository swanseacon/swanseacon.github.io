  description: "<h5>Making Software. Better.</h5>
  <p>Equal Experts’ agile practitioners combine technical excellence and business pragmatism to deliver simple bespoke software solutions to big business problems.</p>
  <p>We offset delivery risk by trusting only talented, highly experienced people to employ relentless quality processes and a “zero tolerance” attitude to defects. We make heavy use of open source technology wherever possible, which dramatically lowers total cost of ownership for clients.</p>
  <p>By leading by example and grounding everything we do in concrete software deliveries, we are able to bring our experience to bear, helping large organizations through their digital transformation.</p>
  <p>Customers include Camelot and Telefonica and our software solutions underpin major initiatives such as O2’s Priority Moments customer loyalty campaign as well as myO2 self-serve capability. We are using our private sector experience to help UK government departments like HMRC and the Home Office to roll out their digital strategy.</p>
  <p>For the last three years in a row, Equal Experts has been singled out as one of UK’s fastest growing companies in the tech sector, with sales reaching £24 million in 2014.</p>"
