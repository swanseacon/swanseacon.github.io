			<h4>About SwanseaCon 2017</h4>

			<p>The conference has a strong practical focus and attracts industry practitioners and decision-makers who want to provide great software to their clients.</p>

				<li>Technical Writer</li>
				<li>Product Owner</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			<p>We’re happy for you to stand up and present a session about your experiences or something you’ve done, but we also strongly encourage interactive sessions that generate conversation with the audience, group discussion, or hands-on experiences</p>
			<h4>Suggested session types:<h4>
			<p><strong>Case Study</strong></p>
			<p>A presentation and discussion of real-life (not theoretical) experiences. Case studies include some discussion of lessons learned and an indication of how novel the work is.</p>
			<p><strong>Tutorial</strong></p>
			<p>A session focused around some specific tool, technique or issue. Primarily led by the speaker, tutorials usually include some elements of interactivity or individual / group exercise.</p>
			<p><strong>Hands-on</strong></p>
			<p>Participants learn a new approach, tool or technology through using it to solve one or more practical exercises. Please include any software/hardware requirements in the session description.</p>
			<p><strong>Workshop</strong></p>
			<p>An in-depth working session on a specific topic. May include paper presentations</p>
			<p>You can submit as many sessions as you like!</p>

			<h4>Expenses</h4>
			<p>We do have some money to help speakers who are personally funding their own way to SwanseaCon 2017 - we would strongly prefer to direct this money to those who most need this support.</p>
			<p>We’ll provide flip charts, pens, a/v equipment etc. but we can also help fund anything out of the ordinary you need to make your session more valuable to your participants and yourself.</p>
			<p>Please let us know on your session proposal whether you need this support to take part in the conference, and, if possible, roughly how much money you’d need to claim from us. (To give you a rough idea, overnight accommodation in the city costs from £45 upwards per night).</p>
			<p><strong>Unfortunately we can’t reimburse expenses that we haven’t agreed to pay in advance of the event.</strong></p>
			
			<h3>Speaker Terms</h3>
			<h4>Session reviews</h4>
			<p>After the deadline closes, our selection panel will review all submissions anonymously.</p>
			<p>The review process usually takes between 2 and 3 weeks depending on the volume of submissions. We’ll contact both successful and unsuccessful candidates within the review period.</p>

			<p>The organisers reserve the right to remove a session from the programme at any time. Speakers will no longer be eligible for free entry to the conference and so will have to pay the current non-speaker rate if they wish to participate in the conference.</p>
			<p>The organisers will not be responsible for payment of any kind on behalf of the speaker in this event.</p>
