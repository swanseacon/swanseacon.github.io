			<p>Returning for its 4th year on Monday 10th September 2018, SwanseaCon is a practical Agile Development and Software Craftsmanship conference that allows participants to connect and learn from their peers and leaders in the industry.</p>
			<p>The conference has a strong practical focus and attracts industry practitioners and decision-makers who want to provide great software to their clients.</p>
			<p>We’re happy for you to stand up and present a session about your experiences or something you’ve done, but we also strongly encourage interactive sessions that generate conversation with the audience, group discussion, or hands-on experiences</p>

			<h4>Expenses</h4>
			<p>We do have some money to help speakers who are personally funding their own way to SwanseaCon 2018 - we would strongly prefer to direct this money to those who most need this support.</p>
			<p>We’ll provide flip charts, pens, a/v equipment etc. but we can also help fund anything out of the ordinary you need to make your session more valuable to your participants and yourself.</p>
			<p>Please let us know on your session proposal whether you need this support to take part in the conference, and, if possible, roughly how much money you’d need to claim from us. (To give you a rough idea, overnight accommodation in the city costs from £70 upwards per night).</p>
			<p><strong>Unfortunately we can’t reimburse expenses that we haven’t agreed to pay in advance of the event.</strong></p>
			
			<h3>Speaker Terms</h3>
			<h4>Session reviews</h4>
			<p>After the deadline closes, our selection panel will review all submissions anonymously.</p>
			<p>The review process usually takes between 2 and 3 weeks depending on the volume of submissions. We’ll contact both successful and unsuccessful candidates within the review period.</p>
			<h4>Data policy</h4>
			<p>We need to hold information you provide on computer databases for administrative purposes. Summary information, which could include contact data, will be published for all session leaders.</p>
			<p>Information about participants will be made available to organisations involved in administering, organising or supporting the event and this may include organisations outside the EC.</p>

			<p>Inclusion of a session in the conference programme will be at the sole discretion of the conference organisers.

			<p>The organisers reserve the right to remove a session from the programme at any time. Speakers will no longer be eligible for free entry to the conference and so will have to pay the current non-speaker rate if they wish to participate in the conference.</p>
			<p>The organisers will not be responsible for payment of any kind on behalf of the speaker in this event.</p>
