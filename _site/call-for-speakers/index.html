Whether it is a user with or without a picture, or if it is a NullObject (UserThatDoesNotExistInSystem), the details don’t need to pollute the views.</p> <p>In this talk, I will show one possible solution for case like that – getting a User representation from the domain and displaying relevant information in web views. The information rendered in UI differs based on whether user exists or not, it’s data and whether the user is being edited or is only to be viewed.</p> <p>The patterns used in the code include (but are not limited to) <ul><li>Exhibit pattern (Avdi Grimm, Object on Rails)</li> <li>Command-Query Responsibility Segregation</li></ul> The best part is. This is live production code written and maintained. By spring 2015 I believe I have gotten some insights about the work, which I am happy to share with.</p> <p>The talk is about showing real production code using the pattern, and using controllers & views with very few if-statements.</p> <hr> <div class="people-details"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-2 col-sm-2"> <div class="flow-img img-circle people-img" style="background-image: url(/img/people/AkiSalmi.jpg)"></div> </div> <div class="col-md-10 col-sm-10 details"> <p class="name">Aki Salmi <span class="position">, Ambientia</span> </p> <p class="about"><p>Aki has mixed work roles.

One of his profession is to be hiking guide. Leading people in circumstances where earning trust really makes a difference.</p> <p>And, he has learned a new profession, where he aims to bring joy and meaning to work teams' lives. Where the work teams are teachers, nurses, or such. </p> <p>All this is because Aki is great listener and excellent in building trusting and safe environments</p></p> <ul class="social"> <li> <a href="http://twitter.com/rinkkasatiainen" target="_blank"> <svg class="icon icon-twitter" viewBox="0 0 30 32"> <use xlink:href="/img/sprites/sprites.svg#icon-twitter"></use> </svg> </a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="modal fade text-left people-modal" id="speakerDetail-2" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="speakerDetailLabel-2" aria-hidden="true"> <div class="modal-dialog"> <div class="modal-content"> <div class="modal-body"> <div class="close"> <svg class="icon icon-cross" viewBox="0 0 32 32"> <use xlink:href="/img/sprites/sprites.svg#icon-cross"></use> </svg> <div class="close-mask" data-dismiss="modal"></div> </div> <h4>Software Craftsmanship vs Lean Product</h4> <p class="theme-description"><p>You want to get your product out to users, but you want to write clean code. Test your market fast but keep the product maintainable. Lean product development and software craftsmanship just can’t work together, right?</p> <p>In the red corner, we have Elizabeth Ayer, Product Manager at Redgate. She loves Minimum Viable Products, cunning experiments, and The Lean Startup is her bible. Craftsmanship to her means wasting time polishing internals. Everyone loves sausages regardless of what goes on inside the factory.</p> <p>In the blue corner, we have Alastair Smith, Founder of the Cambridge Software Craftsmanship Community. He loves clean code, test-driven development, and The Pragmatic Programmer is his bible. Lean product development to him means half-finished products, mountains of technical debt. It’s less “fail cheap, fail often”, than just simply “#fail”.</p> <p>Does Craftsmanship take focus off the end user? Does Lean make poor trade-offs between speed and quality? Can the same team follow both principles? Alastair and Elizabeth will explore common misconceptions, as well as genuine areas of contention between the two approaches. Come see if they can ever join forces to create products users love.</p></p> <hr> <div class="people-details"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-2 col-sm-2"> <div class="flow-img img-circle people-img" style="background-image: url(/img/people/AlastairSmith.jpg)"></div> </div> <div class="col-md-10 col-sm-10 details"> <p class="name">Alastair Smith <span class="position">, Redgate Software Ltd</span> </p> <p class="about"><p>Alastair is part of the team at Redgate building ingeniously simple tools.

He has a passion for rooting out and destroying legacy code, and for promoting good practice in teams.</p> <p>He is the founder of the Cambridge Software Craftsmanship Community and a co-organiser of DDD East Anglia.</p></p> <ul class="social"> <li> <a href="http://twitter.com/alastairs" target="_blank"> <svg class="icon icon-twitter" viewBox="0 0 30 32"> <use xlink:href="/img/sprites/sprites.svg#icon-twitter"></use> </svg> </a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="modal fade text-left people-modal" id="speakerDetail-3" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="speakerDetailLabel-3" aria-hidden="true"> <div class="modal-dialog"> <div class="modal-content"> <div class="modal-body"> <div class="close"> <svg class="icon icon-cross" viewBox="0 0 32 32"> <use xlink:href="/img/sprites/sprites.svg#icon-cross"></use> </svg> <div class="close-mask" data-dismiss="modal"></div> </div> <h4>Skills For Crafts</h4> <p class="theme-description"><p>Software Development Skills do not just happen. So, you need to take the bull by the horns and do it yourself. You need to make a plan because these skills rarely develop during your workdays. You also need to dedicate time to develop these skills. While in other craftsmanship, skills of good crafts are well-known. In software development, there is no consensus on this topic. In this talk, we are going to discuss the main skills every good developer should have and how to improve them. We will also share with you some tips and tricks but also some exercises we used to improve our software development skills. </p> <hr> <div class="people-details"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-2 col-sm-2"> <div class="flow-img img-circle people-img" style="background-image: url(/img/people/BorisGonnot.jpg)"></div> </div> <div class="col-md-10 col-sm-10 details"> <p class="name">Boris Gonnot <span class="position">, BISAM</span> </p> <p class="about"><p></p></p> <ul class="social"> <li> <a href="http://twitter.com/gonnot" target="_blank"> <svg class="icon icon-twitter" viewBox="0 0 30 32"> <use xlink:href="/img/sprites/sprites.svg#icon-twitter"></use> </svg> </a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="modal fade text-left people-modal" id="speakerDetail-35" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="speakerDetailLabel-35" aria-hidden="true"> <div class="modal-dialog"> <div class="modal-content"> <div class="modal-body"> <div class="close"> <svg class="icon icon-cross" viewBox="0 0 32 32"> <use xlink:href="/img/sprites/sprites.svg#icon-cross"></use> </svg> <div class="close-mask" data-dismiss="modal"></div> </div> <h4>Get your head in the Clouds!</h4> <p class="theme-description"><p>If someone had said to you a few years back that they could build an app, 'push' to the cloud and even scale it in a matter of minutes with a few simple commands, you'd have most likely responded; 'You've got your head in the clouds'.</p> <p>Times do change.

Test your market fast but keep the product maintainable. Lean product development and software craftsmanship just can’t work together, right?</p> <p>In the red corner, we have Elizabeth Ayer, Product Manager at Redgate. She loves Minimum Viable Products, cunning experiments, and The Lean Startup is her bible. Craftsmanship to her means wasting time polishing internals. Everyone loves sausages regardless of what goes on inside the factory.</p> <p>In the blue corner, we have Alastair Smith, Founder of the Cambridge Software Craftsmanship Community. He loves clean code, test-driven development, and The Pragmatic Programmer is his bible. Lean product development to him means half-finished products, mountains of technical debt. It’s less “fail cheap, fail often”, than just simply “#fail”.</p> <p>Does Craftsmanship take focus off the end user? Does Lean make poor trade-offs between speed and quality? Can the same team follow both principles? Alastair and Elizabeth will explore common misconceptions, as well as genuine areas of contention between the two approaches. Come see if they can ever join forces to create products users love.</p></p> <hr> <div class="people-details"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-2 col-sm-2"> <div class="flow-img img-circle people-img" style="background-image: url(/img/people/ElizabethAyer.jpeg)"></div> </div> <div class="col-md-10 col-sm-10 details"> <p class="name">Elizabeth Ayer <span class="position">, Redgate Software Ltd</span> </p> <p class="about"><p>Elizabeth Ayer is a product manager at Redgate Software, a company with 15 years' experience in Database Lifecycle Management.

Current methods for task estimation are subjective and inconsistent. This often results in failed sprints, which -in turn- lead to delivery failures, loss of credibility and team friction. We can't always estimate complexity and effort accurately, but there is a way to ensure our estimates are the best we can give, every single time, all the time.</p> <p>The USP (User Story Point) estimation method is an algorithmic approach that takes into account technical and environmental factors affecting a User Story and uses a mathematical formula to produce a complexity point value.</p> <p>During this talk I will explain the motivation and workings of the USP methodology and I'll demonstrate how to use it to provide consistent, objective and reliable estimates.</p></p> <h4>User-Story Point estimation: a new approach (Workshop)</h4> <p class="theme-description"><p>This hands-on session will consist of a realistic scenario, where the audience will have the chance to apply the USP method to a project and thereby gain a better understanding of the USP methodology</p></p> <hr> <div class="people-details"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-2 col-sm-2"> <div class="flow-img img-circle people-img" style="background-image: url(/img/people/FredHeath.jpg)"></div> </div> <div class="col-md-10 col-sm-10 details"> <p class="name">Fred Heath <span class="position">, Independent</span> </p> <p class="about"><p>Fred is a software jack of all trades based in Cardiff, Wales.

So, you need to take the bull by the horns and do it yourself. You need to make a plan because these skills rarely develop during your workdays. You also need to dedicate time to develop these skills. While in other craftsmanship, skills of good crafts are well-known. In software development, there is no consensus on this topic. In this talk, we are going to discuss the main skills every good developer should have and how to improve them. We will also share with you some tips and tricks but also some exercises we used to improve our software development skills. </p> <hr> <div class="people-details"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-2 col-sm-2"> <div class="flow-img img-circle people-img" style="background-image: url(/img/people/HoussamFakih.jpg)"></div> </div> <div class="col-md-10 col-sm-10 details"> <p class="name">Houssam Fakih <span class="position">, Arolla</span> </p> <p class="about"><p>I'm a software engineer at Arolla.

Or, how do regular expressions work?</h4> <p class="theme-description"><p>All abstractions are leaky, and we tend to think of that as a bad thing. But sometimes it’s useful to be reminded of the implementation details. Knowing how something works under the covers often makes it a lot easier to use the abstraction. Take regular expressions - very powerful, yet very hard to use - arguably a write-only language! But once you know how the abstraction works, reading and writing a regular expression becomes a lot easier. In this talk, we’ll take a look at some popular, perhaps overlooked, abstractions, see how they work, and see how understanding the level below an abstraction makes you a better developer.</p></p> <hr> <div class="people-details"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-2 col-sm-2"> <div class="flow-img img-circle people-img" style="background-image: url(/img/people/MattEllis.jpg)"></div> </div> <div class="col-md-10 col-sm-10 details"> <p class="name">Matt Ellis <span class="position">, JetBrains</span> </p> <p class="about"><p>Matt Ellis is a developer advocate at JetBrains.

What do they need to learn? How can we teach these things? Post-university, can we use the same principles to develop effective training and development programmes for professionals?</p> <p>Many university degree programmes provide students with a solid grounding in the theoretical basis of computing, but it is difficult in a university environment to provide training in the types of software engineering techniques and practices, such as agile methods, that are commonly used in industrial development projects. There is typically a large gap between theoretical knowledge and practical experience.</p> <p>In this session we will present how we have developed a programme that aims to bridge this gap, providing students with practical experience of relevant skills for industrial software engineering careers. We will give examples from courses at both Imperial College and Oxford. We are aiming to create courses that are practical and industrially relevant, but built on the fundamentals of computer science and rigorous engineering.</p> <p>The first part of this session will be a talk giving some reflections on trying to improve the quality of a university course. Taking inspiration from modern ideas on lean and continuous delivery, we tried to adapt the course to provide higher quality learning, and give more value to the time the students spent studying. Universities are traditional organisations with long histories of doing things a certain way, and so whilst we had a lot of freedom over the content of the course, changing the format and the delivery methods was a lot harder.</p> <p>We applied principles and tools from agile methods, aiming to increase the value of the time the students spent studying by providing feedback and learning in smaller batches, aided by automation. On a practical level, we will discuss the use of version control, automated testing, automated build and continuous integration for student exercises, and the effects that this has had. We will also discuss our attempts to teach the value of continuous delivery in larger student projects, the problems we have had with this, and ideas for future improvements.</p></p> <h4>Education for Engineers (Workshop)</h4> <p class="theme-description"><p>How can we best design education programmes that prepare students to be effective software engineers in the modern world? What do they need to learn? How can we teach these things? Post-university, can we use the same principles to develop effective training and development programmes for professionals?</p> <p>We will introduce the technique of Reverse Instructional Design, and change to a workshop phase. We will also discuss applying agile techniques and systems thinking to the design of the educational experience.</p> <p>We will draw on the expertise and experience in the room to discuss (in small groups) the most important things for people to learn to work effectively in software development, and then try to design new possible course structures to address these using the techniques described. To finish we will compile the outputs from the groups.</p></p> <hr> <div class="people-details"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-2 col-sm-2"> <div class="flow-img img-circle people-img" style="background-image: url(/img/people/RobertChatley.png)"></div> </div> <div class="col-md-10 col-sm-10 details"> <p class="name">Robert Chatley <span class="position">, Imperial College London</span> </p> <p class="about"><p>Robert is a visiting lecturer in Software Engineering at Imperial College London, and at the University of Oxford.

Tests are performed through the user interface. When testing gets automated, this is where most organisations start. They start with automating the way they do things now. The new way is faster, but it isn’t fast enough. And not robust enough.</p> <p>It is unnecessarily complicated to understand why an end-to-end test fails. There are usually many different possibilities when something doesn’t work.</p> <p>The number of possible paths through a reasonably large application will very fast make it impossible to cover them all. Combinatorics is your enemy.</p> <p>The solution is to minimise the tests that passes through many layers in your application. Minimising doesn’t mean removing the end-to-end tests. They are still needed. But much fewer than most organisations seem to think.</p> <p>I will show you why the testing pyramid need to be very wide. You will understand why this is an absolute necessity if all possible paths through the application should be tested.</p> <p>In other words, let me show you why your tests must be very shallow.</p></p> <hr> <div class="people-details"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-2 col-sm-2"> <div class="flow-img img-circle people-img" style="background-image: url(/img/people/ThomasSudberg.png)"></div> </div> <div class="col-md-10 col-sm-10 details"> <p class="name">Thomas Sundberg <span class="position">, Independent</span> </p> <p class="about"><p>Thomas Sundberg is an independent consultant based in Stockholm, Sweden.

I believe that this is what will be changed in the nearest future, revolutionary. Software teams will become more disciplined and organized. We won't use meetings as tools of management, design and architecture. In my presentation I will try to demonstrate how meetings can be replaced by a disciplined management process, empowered by modern tools or collaboration, diagramming and coding.</p></p> <hr> <div class="people-details"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-2 col-sm-2"> <div class="flow-img img-circle people-img" style="background-image: url(/img/people/YegorBugayenko.jpg)"></div> </div> <div class="col-md-10 col-sm-10 details"> <p class="name">Yegor Bugayenko <span class="position">, Teamed.io</span> </p> <p class="about"><p>Yegor is a CTO and co-founder of Teamed.io, a software development company with a unique approach to management of distributed teams; a regular blogger at www.yegor256.com; a proud holder of PMP and OCMEA certifications; a hands-on Java developer and a lead architect of a few popular open source projects, including jcabi.com, takes.org, rultor.com and qulice.com.
