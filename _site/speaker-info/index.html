According to many, this is not achievable and can only cause confusion and undisciplined dynamics, according to others, instead, a self-aware and self-organised team is the only option to achieve the expected benefits of an agile transformation.</p></p> <hr> <div class="people-details"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-2 col-sm-2"> <div class="flow-img img-circle people-img" style="background-image: url(/img/people/AndreaRizzo.jpg)"></div> </div> <div class="col-md-10 col-sm-10 details"> <p class="name">Andrea Rizzo <span class="position">, Accenture</span> </p> <p class="about"><p>Born in Italy but currently living in the beautiful England, I'm Scrum Master and Agile Lead @ Accenture UKI. I started studying Communication and Information Techniques and eventually diverted to International Business with a Masters that taught me the art of analysing figures, processes and data. I'm an active certified Scrum Professional (CSP) and ISEB/BCS certified BA and Tester. I reckon I fully understand the benefits and values underlying the good practice of being agile and recommend its usage in the chaotic word of development. I coach people and try to remove any impediments that prevent teams from reaching their goals.</p></p> <ul class="social"> <li> <a href="http://twitter.com/andrearizzo86" target="_blank"> <svg class="icon icon-twitter" viewBox="0 0 30 32"> <use xlink:href="/img/sprites/sprites.svg#icon-twitter"></use> </svg> </a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="modal fade text-left people-modal" id="speakerDetail-26" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="speakerDetailLabel-26" aria-hidden="true"> <div class="modal-dialog"> <div class="modal-content"> <div class="modal-body"> <div class="close"> <svg class="icon icon-cross" viewBox="0 0 32 32"> <use xlink:href="/img/sprites/sprites.svg#icon-cross"></use> </svg> <div class="close-mask" data-dismiss="modal"></div> </div> <h4>Defining MVP with Scenarios</h4> <p class="theme-description"><p>What is the minimal version of the product that should be build? How to define what is in and what is out? I will suggest a technique that helps to leave emotions and company politics out of the MVP equation. The centre of this technique is scenarios, stories that describe how people use the product. Applied to different projects with different stakeholders, this approach works over and over again helping to make MVP live as early as possible.</p></p> <hr> <div class="people-details"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-2 col-sm-2"> <div class="flow-img img-circle people-img" style="background-image: url(/img/people/ArvidTorset.jpg)"></div> </div> <div class="col-md-10 col-sm-10 details"> <p class="name">Arvid Torset <span class="position">, SeniorDev</span> </p> <p class="about"><p>Building software development teams from ground up has been Arvid´s main specialty for more than ten years. His task is to assemble the technologies that are suitable for a particular business problem and then find the right set of people and skills for them. He has done this for clients in hugely diverse domains and also for several companies where he was a co-founder. Work on all these projects have revealed the same problem: traditional tools and artefacts are not very suitable to establish efficient communication in team that try to work lean way. It is a new process that is needed, the process that ties all the stakeholders and developers closer together - from the CEO to the QA. Arvid is working on creating this process and teaching the teams to sustain and evolve it.</p></p> <ul class="social"> <li> <a href="http://twitter.com/arvtor" target="_blank"> <svg class="icon icon-twitter" viewBox="0 0 30 32"> <use xlink:href="/img/sprites/sprites.svg#icon-twitter"></use> </svg> </a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="modal fade text-left people-modal" id="speakerDetail-8" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="speakerDetailLabel-8" aria-hidden="true"> <div class="modal-dialog"> <div class="modal-content"> <div class="modal-body"> <div class="close"> <svg class="icon icon-cross" viewBox="0 0 32 32"> <use xlink:href="/img/sprites/sprites.svg#icon-cross"></use> </svg> <div class="close-mask" data-dismiss="modal"></div> </div> <h4>Agile and strategic thinking</h4> <p class="theme-description"><p>How do we measure success in Agile? some would say it’s easy, just measure customer satisfaction, others (whilst perhaps misinformed) might look to try and compare development team velocity.</p> <p>So what does a good metric look like? In this talk I will describe the metrics that can be used at the individual, team, department and organisation level and the impact on behaviour and performance of choosing a good metric and also the negative impact when choosing a poor metric. </p> <p>How we used vision, strategic objectives and measures of success to help ensure our teams had the autonomy to prioritise and deliver against the goals they set. Using the knowledge of what the business was trying to deliver as a strategic level to help support decision making at the team level.</p></p> <hr> <div class="people-details"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-2 col-sm-2"> <div class="flow-img img-circle people-img" style="background-image: url(/img/people/DavidLeach.jpg)"></div> </div> <div class="col-md-10 col-sm-10 details"> <p class="name">David Leach <span class="position">, Office Depot EU</span> </p> <p class="about"><p>Having spent 15 years in Digital teams working in most roles within the software dev lifecycle, I am now a Senior Product Manager working on strategy and innovation for Office Depot.</p> <p>I run the meetup Lean Coffee Milton Keynes having helped run the London ones and I also blog here: http://www.leanintoagile.com</p></p> <ul class="social"> <li> <a href="http://twitter.com/agileleachy" target="_blank"> <svg class="icon icon-twitter" viewBox="0 0 30 32"> <use xlink:href="/img/sprites/sprites.svg#icon-twitter"></use> </svg> </a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="modal fade text-left people-modal" id="speakerDetail-22" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="speakerDetailLabel-22" aria-hidden="true"> <div class="modal-dialog"> <div class="modal-content"> <div class="modal-body"> <div class="close"> <svg class="icon icon-cross" viewBox="0 0 32 32"> <use xlink:href="/img/sprites/sprites.svg#icon-cross"></use> </svg> <div class="close-mask" data-dismiss="modal"></div> </div> <h4>TBC</h4> <p class="theme-description"><p>Information to follow</p></p> <hr> <div class="people-details"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-2 col-sm-2"> <div class="flow-img img-circle people-img" style="background-image: url(/img/people/DaveSnowden.jpg)"></div> </div> <div class="col-md-10 col-sm-10 details"> <p class="name">Prof Dave Snowden <span class="position">, Bangor University</span> </p> <p class="about"><p>Dave Snowden divides his time between two roles: founder Chief Scientific Officer of Cognitive Edge and the founder and Director of the Centre for Applied Complexity at Bangor University in Wales His work is international in nature and covers government and industry looking at complex issues relating to strategy, organisational decision making and decision making.

Okay, since you’re reading this it seems that you're at least thinking about going to conferences to learn. But is learning once a year enough? If not, how do you grow on an everyday basis? How can you become a better tester? And what about learning as a team, company, community? In this talk, I will share my personal experience and concrete tips on how to re-invent yourself and the world around you.

How to define what is in and what is out? I will suggest a technique that helps to leave emotions and company politics out of the MVP equation.

Applied to different projects with different stakeholders, this approach works over and over again helping to make MVP live as early as possible.</p></p> <hr> <div class="people-details"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-2 col-sm-2"> <div class="flow-img img-circle people-img" style="background-image: url(/img/people/TatianaKolesnikova.jpg)"></div> </div> <div class="col-md-10 col-sm-10 details"> <p class="name">Tatiana Kolesnikova <span class="position">, SeniorDev</span> </p> <p class="about"><p>Design and development are not two poles apart.

Could it be that all these unit tests are wasting our time, and that we'd be better off getting on writing -- and system testing -- the code we're actually paid to produce? This presentation draws on personal experience and on the wisdom of Sir Tony Hoare, James Coplien, Donald Knuth, and others in an attempt to answer this question.</p></p> <hr> <div class="people-details"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-2 col-sm-2"> <div class="flow-img img-circle people-img" style="background-image: url(/img/people/ThomasGuest.jpeg)"></div> </div> <div class="col-md-10 col-sm-10 details"> <p class="name">Thomas Guest <span class="position">, Clinithink</span> </p> <p class="about"><p>Thomas Guest is an experienced and enthusiastic software developer who likes puzzles, programming, running and noodles.
