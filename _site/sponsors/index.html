Agile and DevOps are “the new kids on the block” but are fast becoming mainstream. What are the roots of the changes and popularity of new approaches and how have they evolved over the years? What prophets were around years ago who foresaw current trends? In this presentation, Dorothy Graham leads you through some of her early experiences in testing and early encounters with precursors to Agile and DevOps. We look at why Agile has “taken off” and why DevOps is a hot topic today, and what the role of testing has been, is now and perhaps should be in the future.</p></p> <hr> <div class="people-details"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-2 col-sm-2"> <div class="flow-img img-circle people-img" style="background-image: url(/img/people/DorothyGraham.jpg)"></div> </div> <div class="col-md-10 col-sm-10 details"> <p class="name">Dorothy Graham <span class="position">Software Testing Consultant, </span> </p> <p class="about"><p>Dorothy Graham has been in software testing for over 40 years, and is co-author of 5 books: Software Inspection, Software Test Automation, Foundations of Software Testing, Experiences of Test Automation and A Journey Through Test Automation Patterns (linking to the wiki TestAutomationPatterns.org.</p> <p>Dot has been on the boards of conferences and publications in software testing, including programme chair for EuroStar (twice).

But this exercise will be broken down into 5 individual requirements, and you will need to coordinate as a team - working individually or in pairs - to deliver the complete solution with each pair only allowed to code their part of the whole. You'll use version control and do Continuous Integration to pull the parts together, and - very importantly - YOU MUST NOT BREAK THE BUILD. In a time limit of one hour, 90% of teams who attempt Evil FizzBuzz fail. You'll have 1 hour to build your team, choose a technology stack, shave some yaks, agree on a design and implement it so that you can demonstrate a working program that passes a simple acceptance test to your 'customer'. You'll need more than Code Fu to master Evil FizzBuzz. Teams can be 5-10 people and a mix of individuals and pairs, depending on the size of the overall group.</p></p> <hr> <div class="people-details"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-2 col-sm-2"> <div class="flow-img img-circle people-img" style="background-image: url(/img/people/JasonGorman.jpg)"></div> </div> <div class="col-md-10 col-sm-10 details"> <p class="name">Jason Gorman <span class="position">Programmer & Trainer, Codemanship</span> </p> <p class="about"><p>Jason Gorman, a software development practitioner, trainer, coach and author based in London with two decades’ experience working with teams in a wide range of industries.</p> <p>Jason has worked with teams at the BBC, City Index, Electronic Arts, Higher Education Statistics Agency, BUPA, British Standards Institute, The Post Office, Merrill Lynch HSBC, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, Orange, Lloyds TSB, AOL, Reed Business Information and Symbian, and many more.</p> <p>Jason chairs the Software Craftsmanship conference in the UK, and is a contributor to other conferences including QCon, Software Practice Advancement, XPDay, Agile Finland, JAX London and CITCON Europe.</p> <p>His web site, parlezuml.com, has been visited by more than a million software professionals since 2003, and his free tutorials on use cases, UML, OO design and Test-driven Development have had more than 500,000 downloads.</p> <p>Jason is a patron of the Bletchley Park Trust, and a fundraiser for programming clubs and the STAK St Austell Community Kitchen</p></p> <ul class="social"> <li> <a href="https://twitter.com/jasongorman" target="_blank"> <svg class="icon icon-twitter" viewBox="0 0 30 32"> <use xlink:href="/img/sprites/sprites.svg#icon-twitter"></use> </svg> </a> </li> <li> <a href="http://www.parlezuml.com/" target="_blank"> <svg class="icon icon-site" viewBox="0 0 30 32"> <use xlink:href="/img/sprites/sprites.svg#icon-site"></use> </svg> </a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="modal fade text-left people-modal" id="speakerDetail-3" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="speakerDetailLabel-3" aria-hidden="true"> <div class="modal-dialog"> <div class="modal-content"> <div class="modal-body"> <div class="close"> <svg class="icon icon-cross" viewBox="0 0 32 32"> <use xlink:href="/img/sprites/sprites.svg#icon-cross"></use> </svg> <div class="close-mask" data-dismiss="modal"></div> </div> <h4>Keynote - Flow. The worst software development methodology in history.

However, no matter how many consultants and coaches are hired to implement increasingly complex process frameworks and methodologies, developers and testers always come up with new simplistic approaches.</p> <p>During this talk, Kim and Sander will feal with Flow: the worst software development methodology in the history ever, taking inspiration from the worst principles and practices from methodologies such as waterfall, RUP, Scrum, Kanban, Lean, BDD, LeSS , SAFe, Spotify and of course everything continuous.

I’m an innovator and think out-of-the-box. When working on new topics or technologies I get passionate about it and drive the change or migration. With that passion, I’m able to move people to change and coach them in the transition with humor, attention and feedback. I learn quickly and can oversee things from different perspectives. I have in-depth knowledge of the financial services industry and I have a good overview of modern technologies and architectures in IT. I can cope with the political environment of senior management and can be quite persuasive, also for people who are higher in hierarchy. I use this to get things done as I’m particularly result oriented.</p> <p>I’m passionate about topics such as agile, Kanban, DevOps and continuous delivery, and the management of the cultural, organizational and technological changes associated with these approaches. I’m experienced in working agile with self-organizing teams. I also supported and coached the transition from a traditional environment to the agile way of working as a senior manager.

Sometimes those discoveries speed us up, but more often than not they slow us down. The more innovative we are, the more we discover, and the higher the risk and uncertainty - so how can we lead, manage and work in a way which embraces that uncertainty and lets us make discoveries early and safely?</p> <p>In this talk, Liz introduces the Cynefin framework to help make sense of different types of situations and how to approach them: the obvious ones, the complicated ones which require expertise, the complex ones in which outcomes emerge, and the chaotic ones that we're usually trying to avoid. Find out how the simple concepts can help us counter our innate human desire for predictability, enabling change and innovation; not just in software development, but in every aspect of our lives.</p></p> <hr> <div class="people-details"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-2 col-sm-2"> <div class="flow-img img-circle people-img" style="background-image: url(/img/people/LizKeogh.jpg)"></div> </div> <div class="col-md-10 col-sm-10 details"> <p class="name">Liz Keogh <span class="position">Lean/Agile Consultant, </span> </p> <p class="about"><p>Liz Keogh is a Lean and Agile consultant based in London.

The worst software development methodology in history. Ever</h4> <p class="theme-description"><p>Ever since we started writing code in the fifties of the previous century, managers and project managers have tried to discipline and structure the way we work. However, no matter how many consultants and coaches are hired to implement increasingly complex process frameworks and methodologies, developers and testers always come up with new simplistic approaches.</p> <p>During this talk, Kim and Sander will feal with Flow: the worst software development methodology in the history ever, taking inspiration from the worst principles and practices from methodologies such as waterfall, RUP, Scrum, Kanban, Lean, BDD, LeSS , SAFe, Spotify and of course everything continuous.

However, there is a danger of using test automation incorrectly. If the wrong tests are automated, then the time and resource spent developing these tests is wasted and very little value is gained. If the right tests are automated, then the value gained from test automation can exceed the cost of developing the test. </p> <p>But how do we decide which tests are best to automate?</p> <p>In this talk, I will show how I try to get the most value out of automated testing by identifying problems with the current test strategy. Tests which are most likely to solve this problem are the ones chosen for automation. </p> <p>Following this, I will suggest various metrics that could be used to demonstrate the value and progress that has been gained from the introduction of automated tests. Demonstrating value is important as support for test automation development will be lost unless there is proven value.</p></p> <hr> <div class="people-details"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-2 col-sm-2"> <div class="flow-img img-circle people-img" style="background-image: url(/img/people/LouiseGibbs.JPG)"></div> </div> <div class="col-md-10 col-sm-10 details"> <p class="name">Louise Gibbs <span class="position">, Malvern Panalytical</span> </p> <p class="about"><p>I am a Software Test Engineer at Malvern Panalytical where we develop scientific instruments for a variety of industries, most notably pharmaceuticals.

Unlawful access to our online information can be prevented by encryption, 2FA and IP detection, but often this isn’t enough. Additionally tools like 2FA can be difficult to configure or understand for the initiated, leaving many at a disadvantage - security should be a right, not a privilege.</p> <p>This session explores some interesting and experimental ways that AI could be used to improve security and protect users on the web.</p> <p>Using existing AI tools like Azure Cognitive Services we’ll look at ways facial or voice recognition could be used as part of 2FA to make security more accessible to end users, including code examples in .NET and JavaScript. Then we’ll investigate some simple methods to find patterns in user behaviour, such as login times and mouse behaviour, to detect anomalies and take action.</p> <p>Finally, we’ll see how machine learning can be used to identify fraudulent text or photoshopped images within webpages and warn users of scams before it becomes an issue.</p> <p>Code examples will be given in a mix of .NET and JavaScript.</p></p> <hr> <div class="people-details"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-2 col-sm-2"> <div class="flow-img img-circle people-img" style="background-image: url(/img/people/CallumWhyte.jpg)"></div> </div> <div class="col-md-10 col-sm-10 details"> <p class="name">Callum Whyte <span class="position">, Bump Digital</span> </p> <p class="about"><p>Callum is a lead developer who's expertise lies in building robust scalable microservice and serverless systems on the .NET stack, as well as Xamarin mobile apps and websites with the Umbraco CMS.</p> <p>Away from his desk you can find him organising community events; from local meetups and hackathons to the annual 300 person Umbraco UK Festival conference.

Has someone asked you to do a task…but what you end up doing turns out to be not what they wanted? Is one team being effective…while another is lagging behind? Using social science models as our guide, we can see why teams can have problems communicating – especially in certain stages of a project's lifetime – and what we can do to address this.</p> <p>We'll start by looking at the Shannon Weaver communication model (1949) and what it tells us about the different phases of successful communication. With this model we'll be able to address exactly where problems can be found between individuals, and how messages can be interpreted inaccurately or sometimes even lost all together. You'll find that the responsibility of effective communication relies on all participants, and not just those receiving the message. After identifying common problems, we'll discuss some potential solutions for you to try implementing with your own teams.</p> <p>But is good communication enough in tough times? By looking at Tuckman's team development model (1965), we'll be able to evaluate why even the best communication practices can fail depending on what stage of development a team is currently in. But…we can do things to address this! We'll look at how communication methods will need to be adapted when teams face tough times, and how comparing the Tuckman and Shannon Weaver models together can better inform our understanding of each.</p> <p>Attendees should come away with some insight in to what goes in to successful communication, the lifecycle that teams go through, and what methods can be used to address common problems we may find with these. Ultimately, an agile approach to both is what will ensure happy successful teams.</p></p> <hr> <div class="people-details"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-2 col-sm-2"> <div class="flow-img img-circle people-img" style="background-image: url(/img/people/SophieHayden.png)"></div> </div> <div class="col-md-10 col-sm-10 details"> <p class="name">Sophie Hayden <span class="position">, Box UK</span> </p> <p class="about"><p>Sophie is a business analyst, product owner and all round agile enthusiast.

This won't be exhaustive, but everyone should leave with a few extra things in their box.</p> <p>While there will be slides, everyone will form themselves into groups, and will then actively participate in a full-scale retrospective example, where we will explore our relationship with meetings at our place of work. The aim is to deliver a fully interactive workshop, where everyone learns about the subject by actually doing it. The activities are carefully spaced over the talk and immediately follow the relevant learning sections.</p> <p>While this talk will furnish everyone with a few example structures, the main purpose is to teach how to structure your own. Everyone should leave with the ability to build their own retrospectives from scratch, pulling in influence from what's happening within the team at that time.</p></p> <hr> <div class="people-details"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-2 col-sm-2"> <div class="flow-img img-circle people-img" style="background-image: url(/img/people/SeanRobinson.JPG)"></div> </div> <div class="col-md-10 col-sm-10 details"> <p class="name">Sean Robinson <span class="position">, DevOps Group</span> </p> <p class="about"><p>Having worked as an engineer, Scrum Master and Product Owner, I now consult on Agile adoption and digital strategy on behalf of DevOps Group.</p> <p>I have a passion for systems thinking, queuing theory, theory of constraints, lean leadership and modern motivational theory; plus anything else that tells me why we do what we do.

No buzzwords or vague statements about accelerating delivery, just straight-up information and hands-on experience.</p> <p>You'll get to build and run containers for yourself. We'll start by installing Docker and I'll aim to get you to the point where you're running your own multi-container application. No previous container experience is needed, but you'll need to be comfortable using a command-line and have a general understanding of networking concepts like ports and web servers.</p> <p>If you're interested in technologies like Kubernetes, container scheduling and Gitops, the aim of this workshop is to get you from a clean slate to a declarative, multi-container application, understanding the concepts involved and setting you up to go on and explore. We won't attempt to get Kubernetes running in this workshop because of time constraints, but I'm happy to talk about my experience of using it.</p> <p>Note: if you're bringing a Windows machine, please double-check the Docker installation requirements here to make sure you'll be able to get Docker running: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/. Older versions of Windows aren't ideal so if in doubt, and if you're comfortable running a Linux virtual machine or using a cloud machine instance, then you'll still be able to do the workshop. I'll recommend you go with Ubuntu because I'm most familiar with it for installing Docker so it'll make it easiest to support you.</p></p> <hr> <div class="people-details"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-2 col-sm-2"> <div class="flow-img img-circle people-img" style="background-image: url(/img/people/DaveCarboni.jpg)"></div> </div> <div class="col-md-10 col-sm-10 details"> <p class="name">Dave Carboni <span class="position">, Notbinary</span> </p> <p class="about"><p>David 'Carbs' Carboni is Chief Technology Officer at Notbinary, a technology and digital transformation consultancy.

But in this session, I want to turn things around and look at applying some of those to solving specific issues that are common within many software development teams.</p> <p>I'll be taking lessons learned from the last 2 years of a major development project and using them to illustrate my points.</p> <p>We'll look at managing your BAs and PMs and how to balance their need to understand exactly how long everything takes versus your team's need to not be over-pressured by artificial deadlines. We'll see how a structured approach to analysing problems encountered in LIVE can make everyone's life easier, and how to prove whether the problem is (or is not) the fault of your software. And how to handle that inevitable case where it is.</p> <p>And we'll look at the problems of implementing uniformity across multiple code-bases and multiple teams delivering multiple releases of multiple features... and where getting your tooling right can give the biggest benefits.</p> <p>Amongst other things...</p></p> <hr> <div class="people-details"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-2 col-sm-2"> <div class="flow-img img-circle people-img" style="background-image: url(/img/people/JoelHammondTurner.jpg)"></div> </div> <div class="col-md-10 col-sm-10 details"> <p class="name">Joel Hammond-Turner <span class="position">, Landmark Information Group</span> </p> <p class="about"><p>Tech Lead, Landmark Information Group</p> <p>I've a very broad experience of software development over 15 years and a passion for both technology and elegance in my solutions that make me an extremely capable software architect.</p> <p>Personable and professional, I revel in complex challenges, but always make time to coach and mentor team members.</p></p> <ul class="social"> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <!-- End Speakers Modals --> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-57225674-1', 'swanseacon.co.uk'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script> window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/js/jquery-2.1.1.min.js><\/script>') </script> <script src="//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.2.0/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script> <script> if (typeof($.fn.modal) === 'undefined') { document.write('<script src="/js/bootstrap.min.js><\/script>') } </script> <script src="/js/default.js"></script> <script> Waves.displayEffect(); </script> <script src="/js/scripts.min.js"></script> <script type="application/ld+json"> [{ "@context" : "http://schema.org", "@type" : "Event", "name" : "SwanseaCon 2019 - Agile Development & Software Crafting conference", "description": "SwanseaCon is a conference for people who build quality software as part of an agile team", "image" : "http://localhost:4000/img/seo/sharing-google-plus.png", "url" : "http://localhost:4000", "startDate" : "2019-09-10T08:30", "doorTime" : "09:00", "endDate" : "2019-09-10T17:00", "location" : { "@type" : "Place", "name" : "Village Hotel", "sameAs" : "https://www.village-hotels.co.uk/hotels/swansea/", "address" : { "@type" : "PostalAddress", "streetAddress" : "Langdon Road", "addressLocality" : "Swansea", "addressRegion" : "", "postalCode" : "SA1 8QY", "addressCountry" : "Wales" }, "geo" : { "@type" : "GeoCoordinates", "latitude" : "51.6212444619971", "longitude" : " -3.9224749359680118" } }, // Not supported yet // "organizer" : { // "@type" : "Organization", // "name" : "SwanseaCon", // "alternateName" : "Viv Richards", // "description" : "Open and volunteer geek communities who create exciting projects and share experience about Google technology with passion.", // "logo" : "http://localhost:4000/img/seo/organizer-logo.png", // "email" : "contact@vivrichards.co.uk", // "sameAs" : "http://www.vivrichards.co.uk/" // }, "subEvent" : { "@type" : "Event", "name" : "Hackathon", "description": "The front doors will be locked because this is after hours, please park behind the building and come to the door nearest the parking lot.<br><br>Our last meeting showed that there was a lot of interest in Android Wear so we decided to put on an Android Wear Hackathon to see what you could come up with!
