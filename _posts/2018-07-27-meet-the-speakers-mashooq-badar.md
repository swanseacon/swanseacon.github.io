#### What’s your session topic?
Nature of Learning


#### Why is your topic important?

Learning is a part of our survival and key to professional success. Understanding its nature helps us to become better learners. In our industry, where technologies and practices evolve so fast, effective learning is an absolute necessity. It is too important for us to simply stumble through, our approach to learning must be deliberate.


#### What are the prerequisites should the audience have for attending your session?


None, or maybe an attentive ear.


#### How long have you been in this industry?

20 Years


#### What is one of those things you wish you knew when you started out in this industry?

Critical Thinking and a deeper understanding of simplicity in Software Design.

#### Have you spoken at or attended SwanseaCon before?

No

#### What made you want to speak at SwanseaCon this year?


Many of my friends have attended and presented at SwanseaCon in the previous years. Their experiences have been amazing. I decided to experience it first hand myself this year.

#### Are there any sessions other than your own which you are looking forward to at SwanseaCon?

I am particularly interested in Sander Hoogendoorn’s talk “Do or don’t. There’s no try. Or is there?”, and  and Nick Tunes take on "Patterns and Heuristics".
