#### Meet the Sponsor: Alcumus Group.

#### Who are you?
Louis Cross – Internal Tech Recruiter at Alcumus

#### What do you do?
I have an awesome job. I’m responsible for recruitment for every technical role at Alcumus. I work really closely with our hiring managers to get the best people into our Alcumus Technology teams to really drive our Tech-led business.

#### How Long have you been in recruitment?
4 years!

#### Have you sponsored or attended SwanseaCon before?

We are super excited to be sponsoring SwanseaCon for the very first time, and really proud to be the Platinum Sponsor! Since we’ve become a sponsor I’ve had messages from friends, ex colleagues and candidates that are interested in what we’re doing in the tech space – and I’ve got loads to tell them! I’d encourage anyone from the Swanseacon audience to get in touch if they’re interested in progressing their career with us.

#### What made you want to attend and also sponsor SwanseaCon this year?

Alcumus has a strong heritage in helping organisations be Safer, Healthier and Stronger through technology-led compliance and risk management. This year we are taking that to a new level and need the best tech talent from the South Wales area to help us get there – it’s a genuinely exciting work that makes a real difference to people’s lives and we wanted to share our vision with the audience at Swanseacon.

#### Are there any sessions that you are looking forward to at SwanseaCon? 
Questioning Requirements: Improving Quality for everyone. Sounds like an interesting topic and ultimately is what our company is about. Looking forward to hearing more about that from a new perspective.
