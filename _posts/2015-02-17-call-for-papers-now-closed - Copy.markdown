We're very excited - not just because of the inordinate amount of caffeine based products consumed -
but also because we are currently putting together
an agenda for the biggest Agile Development & Software Craftsmanship  related event in Wales - [SwanseaCon 2015](http://swancon.co.uk/). The response for our first call for papers for SwanseaCon 2015 was fantastic, around 70 papers were submitted from speakers from all around the world.

The two day conference will take place in the costal city of Wales - Swansea. Swansea is Wales' Waterfront City. It sits on the sandy five mile stretch of Swansea Bay beach and is a great base for exploring the best of South-West Wales - UK.
