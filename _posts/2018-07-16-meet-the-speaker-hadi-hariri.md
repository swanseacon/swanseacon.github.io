#### Whatâ€™s your session topic?  
Amongst other things, it's about the impact of information in our age

#### Why is your keynote topic important?

Nothing

#### How long have you been in this industry? 
Nearly three decades

#### What is one of those things you wish you knew when you started out in this industry? 
Not so much when I started, but in University, I wish I'd have paid more attention to Haskell. 

#### Have you spoken at or attended SwanseaCon before?  
No

#### What made you want to speak at SwanseaCon this year?  
I'd heard great things about the event. 

#### Are there any sessions other than your own which you are looking forward to at SwanseaCon?  
I'm very much interested in topics related to communication and collaboration.
