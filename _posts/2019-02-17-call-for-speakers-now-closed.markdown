#### SwanseaCon 2019 - Call for speakers is now closed.
Thank you to each and every person who took the time to submit to our call for speakers for SwanseaCon 2019.

We had a fantastic response to our call for speakers and are now busy going through lots of submissions.

Keep an eye out over the next few weeks as we will be announcing all of our fantastic speakers.


#### For more advice or information

While we aim to get back to everyone in the next few weeks, due to the volume of submissions we received this may take longer than anticipated so please be patient.

If you do however want to chase up your submission please feel free to get in touch.
