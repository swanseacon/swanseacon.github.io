#### Meet the Speaker: Gem Hill.

#### Whatâ€™s your session topic?

Anxiety Under Test

#### Why is your topic important?
I want to get to a place where the tech industry specifically and humanity in general are more comfortable talking about mental health. It's good for us and will help us be healthier, happier people. I also want to try to reassure people that are or have struggled with mental illness or ill-health that they're not alone.

#### What are the prerequisites should the audience have for attending your session?
An open mind. I want to add here that there are no trigger/content warnings for this talk other than I will be talking about anxiety.

#### How long have you been in this industry?
I've been a tester for 5/6 years now.

#### What is one of those things you wish you knew when you started out in this industry?
The test community is the best! They're so supportive in all aspects of my life and I've made some true friends there.

#### Have you spoken at or attended SwanseaCon before?
No! I'm excited to be here

#### What made you want to speak at SwanseaCon this year?
I love Wales, but haven't really been to Swansea! The conference also looked good and has a good CoC, and isn't Pay to Speak, which all makes me very happy to speak there.

#### Are there any sessions other than your own which you are looking forward to at SwanseaCon?
Gosh. They all look great. I am excited about finally meeting Lisa Crispin, but I'm also looking forward to be surprised by a talk that I didn't think was going to be for me, which tends to happen at all conferences.
