#### SwanseaCon 2018 - Call for speakers is now open.

The call for speakers for the forth year of SwanseaCon is now open and will close on Friday 16th February 2018!

SwanseaCon is an agile development and software craftsmanship conference which is taking place on Monday September 10th 2018, at the Village Hotel, in Swansea, South Wales(UK).  

Whether you have never spoken at a conference, a relatively new speaker or spoken at many events - we want to hear from you!

#### Speakers

We're really pleased to announce that this years opening keynote will be by the fantastic Hadi Hariri (JetBrains), we will be announcing the closing keynote speaker very soon! We already have some speakers lined up including David Stokes (Oracle), Sander Hoogendoorn (DITISAGILE.NL), Kim Van Wilgen (ANVA), and Mashooq Badar (Codurance) - but we have lots more space and so we're putting out a call for speakers.

#### Sessions

We're happy for you to stand up and present a talk about your experiences or something you've done, but we also strongly encourage interactive sessions that generate conversation with the audience, group discussion, or hands-on experiences.

One of the themes of the conference is agile development. If you work or have worked as part of an agile team to deliver software we'd love to hear from you. The other theme is software craftsmanship, it's about well-crafted software, adding value to the software that you help to develop and deliver.

Whilst we ask for talk submissions around agile development and software craftsmanship, below are just some of the talk titles that were submitted, accepted and run at previous SwanseaCon events.
