#### What’s your session topic?
Azure from A-Z
 

#### Why is your topic important?

One of the most important things when learning a new technology or platform is what to google? The rate of change with cloud, and particularly Microsoft Azure makes knowing the foundations and what is available all the more important.

 

#### What are the prerequisites should the audience have for attending your session?

Have been involved in shipping software solutions and appreciate the moving parts involved.

 

#### How long have you been in this industry?

over 20 years

 

#### What is one of those things you wish you knew when you started out in this industry?

You can’t know everything so focus on the basics and areas you enjoy and learn how to be good at googling for everything else

 

#### Have you spoken at or attended SwanseaCon before?

Nope, first time

 

#### What made you want to speak at SwanseaCon this year?

I am proud to represent one of the sponsors this year, Confused.com, and hope to share some of our findings from 6 years in the cloud

 

#### Are there any sessions other than your own which you are looking forward to at SwanseaCon?

Having heard both Hadi Hariri and Sander Hogendoorn speak a few years ago I am looking forward to hearing what they have to say.
