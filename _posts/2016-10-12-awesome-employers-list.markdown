### Awesome Employers list. 

This year we will be doing an Awesome Employers list so please let your boss and their boss now!

If your company sends 5 or more staff (or all IT if < 5) to SwanseaCon 2017, they'll find themselves publicised for investing in staff and will have their logo on the website as an awesome employer, they will also receive a small discount of 15% off tickets. For any organisation, this means a free reputation boost locally!

#### SwanseaCon 2017

Blind early bird tickets are currently on sale for SwanseaCon 2017. The speakers and schedule are yet to be announced which is why the tickets have been made available at a reduced cost but we hope to have a few of this years favourites return as well as lots of new attendees/speakers.

See you there!
