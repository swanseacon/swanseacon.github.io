#### Call for speakers is now closed.

The response to our call for speakers has been amazing, we received over 100 submissions from all over the world.

Our first conference in 2015 saw 2 keynotes, over 20 presentations and a panel discussion. This year we've tried to offer even greater value for money and to give attendees an even better opportunity to learn and share knowledge. There will be an opening and closing keynote by Simon Brown and Sander Hoogendoorn as well as two different tracks containing tutorials, hands on sessions, as well as presentations.

SwanseaCon 2016 is aimed at software developers, software architects, project managers, analysts and consultants.

The event will have a strong practical focus on agile development, software craftsmanship, teams and business, to ensure participants have the opportunity to learn new approaches they can immediately apply in their work.


##### Earl bird tickets

We still have early bird tickets on sale until the end of March which offers you Â£200 off a standard ticket. Tickets include access to both days (Monday 12th- Tuesday 13th), breakfast, lunch, tea/coffee, and access to the evening reception on Monday 12th September.

Don't miss out on the chance to snap up a ticket for possibly the cheapest agile and developer conference you'll attend this year. Once the early bird tickets are gone or the deadline passes that's it!

##### For more advice or information

We'd love to hear from you.
