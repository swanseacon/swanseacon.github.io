#### Call for speakers is now open.

We're really pleased to announce that after a really successful first conference we're going to do it all over again 12-13th September, 2016.

SwanseaCon is aimed at software developers, software architects, project managers, analysts and consultants.

The event has a strong practical focus on agile development, software craftsmanship, teams and business, to ensure participants have the opportunity to learn new approaches they can immediately apply in their work.

Some of our previous attendees have held the following positions:

* Software Engineer
* Senior Consultant
* Software Craftsman
* Lead Software Engineer
* Professor
* Entrepreneur
* Apprentice
* Trainer
* Delivery Director
* Software Architect
* Services Engineer
* Scrum Master
* Director of Digital Services
* Blogger


##### Sessions

We're happy for you to stand up and present a talk about your experiences or something you've done, but we also strongly encourage interactive sessions that generate conversation with the audience, group discussion, or hands-on experiences.

There is no limit to the number of sessions you can submit. Upon submission you will need to select a category which loosely describes your session; presentation, tutorial (includes some group activities), hands-on (practical session - on laptops etc), panel discussion or if your unsure you can enter your own. You will also be able to select how long in length your session will be, we may however have to ask you to vary your session length so it fits into our finished programme.


##### Speaker support

What's included

* 2 nights hotel stay (night before your session/night after)
* Participation in the full event programme
* Lunch on each day you attend
* Refreshments with delegates at designated times
* Free wi-fi at the conference venue
* Delegate pack

Anything not listed above is not included.
Contact us about any specific requests.


###### Expenses

Although our general policy is not to cover speaker expenses we do have some money to help speakers who are personally funding their own way to SwanseaCon - we would strongly prefer to direct this money to those who most need this support.

We'll provide flip charts, pens, a/v equiptment etc. but we can also help fund anything out of the ordinary you need to make your session more valuable to your participants and yourelf.

Please let us know on your session proposal whether you need this support to take part in the conference, and, if possible, roughly how much money you'd need to claim from us. (To give you a rough idea, overnight accomodation in the city costs from Â£79 upwards per night).

Unfortunately we can't reimburse expenses that we haven't agreed to pay in advance of the event.


##### Session reviews

After the deadline closes, our selection panel will review all submissions anonymously.

The review process usually takes between 2 and 3 weeks depending on the volume of submissions. We'll contact both successful and unsuccessful candidates within the review period.
