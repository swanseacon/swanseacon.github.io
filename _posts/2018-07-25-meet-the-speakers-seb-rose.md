#### Meet the Speaker: Seb Rose.

#### Whatâ€™s your session topic?
Whatever your job title, you're actually being paid to think!
 
 
#### Why is your topic important?*

Books, conference talks, the internet are all awash with heuristics, patterns, models and acronyms to help us solve problems. They document how other people have overcome challenges in a way that makes those solutions accessible to others. 

They're not magic formulae. They help us think, but they don't make thinking unnecessary. The ability to think is our 'secret sauce' and we need to start realising that, while experts have valuable things to say, we need to filter their insights through our own experience.
 
 
#### What are the prerequisites should the audience have for attending your session?

None
 

#### How long have you been in this industry?

35 years
 

#### What is one of those things you wish you knew when you started out in this industry?

Not a thing.
 

#### Have you spoken at or attended SwanseaCon before?

Yes
 

#### What made you want to speak at SwanseaCon this year?

I really enjoyed it last year
 

#### Are there any sessions other than your own which you are looking forward to at SwanseaCon?

Probably.... but I haven't looked yet
